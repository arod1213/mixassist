CONVERGE OUTPUT TO MONO (ensure db compensation - -6db?)
SET SENSIBLE MARKERS BASED ON TEMPO
ENSURE PROPER START OFFSET (skip silence + mark first downbeat)

SETUP EXPOSED C ABI FUNCTIONS TO EXPORT FOR SWIFT UI

DOWNBEAT should be based on time differential to get to nearest downbeat from file start

WRITE TESTS FOR NEXT MARKER AND PREV MARKER
-- ensure start offset / downbeat position is accounted for
-- markers should on be nearest bars (multiples of 2 maybe)

ALLOW ADJUSTABLE TOLERANCE FOR EPSILON (next bar / prev bar)
